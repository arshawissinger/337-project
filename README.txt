+++ READ ME PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS +++

To run this project you will want to run server.js and then connect to the locally hosted server via localhost:3000, 
as the server uses port 3000. Once on the website the user can then create a new account through the create user button on the 
toolbar at the top of the website or login as an existing user. For the purposes of testing there are two pre-existing users,
username: Mark, password: 111, as a student account, and username: Admin, password: 1234, as an administrator account. These
accounts can be accessed to demonstrate website functionality such as viewing courses the user is enrolled in, as well as selecting
courses to enroll in via selection with a checkbox before confirming with a button to submit the selections. The themes Light,
Dark, and U of A can be chosen at any time from a drop down menu to change the appearance of the website. The user can also log out
whenever they wish to end their session on the course management website.
